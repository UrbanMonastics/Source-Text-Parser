<p>How long will you people turn my glory into shame, <span class="symbol-star"> *</span>
love what is worthless, and pursue lies?
<span class="extract-selah">selah</span>
But know that the LORD has set apart the faithful for himself; <span class="symbol-star"> *</span>
the LORD hears when I cry out to him.
Tremble in your anger but do not sin; <span class="symbol-dagger"> &#8224;</span>
meditate in your heart, <span class="symbol-star"> *</span>
while on your bed, and be still.
<span class="extract-selah">SELAH</span>
Offer your righteous sacrifices, <span class="symbol-star"> *</span>
and trust in the LORD.</p>
