How long will you people turn my glory into shame, [*]
	love what is worthless, and pursue lies?
selah
But know that the LORD has set apart the faithful for himself; [*]
	the LORD hears when I cry out to him.
Tremble in your anger but do not sin; [t]
	meditate in your heart, [*]
	while on your bed, and be still.
SELAH
Offer your righteous sacrifices, [*]
	and trust in the LORD.
