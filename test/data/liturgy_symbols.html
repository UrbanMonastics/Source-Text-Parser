<p>Lord, <span class="symbol-cross">&#10011;</span> open my lips.<span class="symbol-star">*</span><br />
And my mouth will declair your praise.</p>
<p>To this you were called,<span class="symbol-dagger">&#8224;</span><br />
because Christ suffered for you,<span class="symbol-star">*</span><br />
leaving us an example to follow, that we should walk in his steps.</p>
