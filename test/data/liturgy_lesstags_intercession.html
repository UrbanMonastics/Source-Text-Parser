<p>Praise be to God the Father, he wanted, through his eternal word, to make his chosen people reborn from an incorruptible seed. Let us ask together in Faith.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Lord, show favor to your people</em>
<br />Hear us, merciful God, the prayers which we offer in favor for all your people,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– That we prefer the satisfaction of your word rather than bread.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Lord, show favor to your people</em>
<br />Teach us, all who are inclined to love, to have an effective and genuine love for your creation and for all people without exception.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– Building towards everlasting good will and peace.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Lord, show favor to your people</em>
<br />Look at all those regenerated by baptism,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– Consecrate them to yourself, making them living stones in the temple of your Spirit.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Lord, show favor to your people</em>
<br />That many, in the way of Jonahs preaching to the Ninevites, repent in their youth,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– by your word,touch and convert their hearts.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Lord, show favor to your people</em>
<br />Grant the dying to go with hope to meet Christ their judge,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– and to enjoy your presence forever.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Lord, show favor to your people</em>
