[II]Praise be to God the Father, he wanted, through his eternal word, to make his chosen people reborn from an incorruptible seed. Let us ask together in Faith.  
[IR]Lord, show favor to your people  
[I1]Hear us, merciful God, the prayers which we offer in favor for all your people,  
[I2]That we prefer the satisfaction of your word rather than bread.  
[I1]Teach us, all who are inclined to love, to have an effective and genuine love for your creation and for all people without exception.  
[I2]Building towards everlasting good will and peace.  
[I1]Look at all those regenerated by baptism,  
[I2]Consecrate them to yourself, making them living stones in the temple of your Spirit.  
[I1]That many, in the way of Jonahs preaching to the Ninevites, repent in their youth,  
[I2]by your word,touch and convert their hearts.  
[I1]Grant the dying to go with hope to meet Christ their judge,  
[I2]and to enjoy your presence forever.
